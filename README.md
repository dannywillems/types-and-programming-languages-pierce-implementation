# Types and programming languages - Benjamin C. Pierce.

« Types and Programming Languages » mainly written by Benjamin C. Pierce is an
excellent start to deeply understand the foundations of programming languages,
and specially typed and functional programming languages. The theorical (with
some small mathematics definitions) and the practical (implemantation and
examples) are given in the entire book.

Lots of exercices are provided in the book and ML implementations
(using [https://ocaml.org](OCaml)) are given.

This repository aims to provide these implementations (and more) in different programming languages with more explanations about it.

## Why do you recommend to understand the theorical aspects of programming languages?

I'm convinced to be a good developer, you don't only need to know the entire syntax of your favorite programming languages but you also need to understand
* how it works internally. It implies to know how the compiler/interpreter works.
* what are the pros and cons of the programming language, the syntax (how to
  write an expression/instruction) and the semantic (i.e. how
  expressions/instructions are executed).
* how the language resolves some common problems.
